#C++ Quiz Game
School project for Programming 101 class.

This is a C++ console program which is a quiz game, testing over the C++ langugage. 
The quiz is a ten question quiz and the questions are loaded in random order from quiz_data.txt. This project is one of the very first major projects I have ever worked on through C++ and programming in general.  

Also my first time using git/github.
